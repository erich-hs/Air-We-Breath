## About The Project
Research on nonstationary multivariate time series modelling for missing value imputation and forecasting on air quality datasets.

### Aim
As a study in progress with faculty members of the Mathematics & Statistics and Computer Science and Information System departments, the goal is to publish a novel approach to the aforementioned on low and high volatile air monitoring datasets.

## About this Repository
This repository contains exploratory and development notebooks for the methods in study, as well as master datasets of currently explored air quality index stations.
